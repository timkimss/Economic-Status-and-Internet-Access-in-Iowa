Federal Communications Commission Form 477 from: https://www.fcc.gov/economics-analytics/industry-analysis-division/form-477-resources

Bureau of Economic Analysis Annual Personal Income By County (CAINC1) Form from: https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas


As humans enter the fourth industrial age, technology has increased exponentially. To support this technological revolution, a new demand for internet access has flourished and as such, companies are developing new ways to provide internet services to the masses. However, this expansion of internet access has not been implemented equally, with companies focusing on larger cities rather than rural areas. In our project, we determined the significance between a personâ€™s income and location to their internet speeds and access types. 
To come to our conclusion, we utilized two different datasets. We used the Federal Communications Commission Form 477, a dataset which contained 17 different columns of information, such as Logical Record Number, Provider Name, Provider ID, Technology Code, and more. We also used the Bureau of Economic Analysis Annual Personal Income By County (CAINC1) Form, a dataset which showed the number of people, the total income, and per capita income from 2001 to 2017 within each of the ninety-nine counties in Iowa.
